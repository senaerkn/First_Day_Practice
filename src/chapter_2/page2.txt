Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,
on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and
commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger
readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[5]
As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide,
making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into
more than eighty languages.[6] The last four books consecutively set records as the
fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million
copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four
hours of its release.

The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros.
 Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,
 [7] making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling.
