Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling.
The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger
and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to
become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and
 subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).



Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,
on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and
commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger
readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[5]
As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide,
making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into
more than eighty languages.[6] The last four books consecutively set records as the
fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million
copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four
hours of its release.

The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros.
 Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,
 [7] making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling.
